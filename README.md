  <h1>Project 1</h1>
  <p>"The data is like a mapâ€”it assists to visualize exactly where you are, where you've been, and where you need to go."
    Decision-making in modern times without data is equivalent to venturing out without navigational guidance. Public washrooms maintained by the Water and Sewer department of the City of Vancouver must be kept properly functional with both repairs and cleaning necessary for public convenience. We built an AWS-based data solution for monitoring usage and maintenance requirements along with accessibility enhancements of such facilities.
    Through effective data management we can determine public toilet usage rates to decide appropriate maintenance levels that benefit residents inside the area and those passing through it. Effective data management assists local governments to take better decisions through improved resource allocations which results in an overall improved service quality.

  <h2> 1 DATA INJECTION.(S3 Bucket)</h2>
  <p>Data ingestion refers to the operational method of extracting valuable information from multiple information sources. Data is gathered through three primary sources: IoT sensors used to monitor possessions, reports filed by maintenance staff members and the Open Data Portal of Vancouver that contains washroom and sewer-related data. The collected data helps both decision-making processes and analytical activities.

  <h2> DATA PROFILING</h2>
  <p>Data Profiling:
    Here, we will review the dataset so that we can achieve the following with AWS:
    Data structure: Column count, column name, column position and data type
     Content: The values in the column that include the lowest, highest, mean, average, etc.

  <h2> DATA CATALOGING</h2>
  <p>Data-Cataloging
    AWS Glue Catalog serves as the tool to manage dataset catalogs.
    Establish metadata tables with attributes for washroom facilities and sewer hookup information and maintenance record tracking.
    The system requires rules which determine authorized access to vital information.
    Why is this done?
    Makes information readily searchable. AWS Glue Catalog facilitates analysts and urban workers to easily access important datasets.
